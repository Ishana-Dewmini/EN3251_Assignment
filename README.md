These lab documents investigates the implementation of transferring information via MQTT using JSON objects. To achieve this
objective in this lab exercise, two procedures are followed. The first one involves reading sensor values in an IoT node,
converting them into a JSON object, and transmitting it to another IoT node through an MQTT broker for the purpose of
controlling the device in that IoT node. The second procedure involves reading data from an existing database, converting
it into a JSON format, and publishing it to a broker. In addition, this lab demonstrates how to develop a user interface to
analyze data received from a broker using Node-RED platform
